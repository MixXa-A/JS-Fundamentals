//Write a function, 
// which changes the value of odd and even numbers in an array of numbers.

//Â· If the number is even - add to its value its index position

// If the number is odd - subtract to its value its index position

//Output

//On the first line print the newly modified array
// , on the second line print the sum of numbers from the original 
// array, on the third line print the sum of numbers from the modified array.
